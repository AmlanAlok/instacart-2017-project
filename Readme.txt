I used Google Colab to perform my experiments. You can run this on Google Colab as well.


****NOTE***

The dataset for the project is big so I have stored the dataset in my Google Drive and used Google Drive mount on Colab to access.

You will have to download the dataset and do the setup or I will have to grant you access.

Please let me know if this is the case.

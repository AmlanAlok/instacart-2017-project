Please find the project report here â€” 

You can find the results of my experiments in the Instacart_Results.xlsx file.


Instacart_2017_XGBoost_05.ipynb => Exp 1 done here

Instacart_2017_XGBoost_06.ipynb => Exp 2,3 done here

Instacart_2017_PCA_01.ipynb => used to implment PCA and find suitable clusters

Instacart_2017_PCA_02.ipynb => Exp 4 done here

Instacart_2017_PCA_03.ipynb => Exp 5 done here


I used Google Colab to perform my experiments. You can run this on Google Colab as well.


****NOTE***

The dataset for the project is big so I have stored the dataset in my Google Drive and used Google Drive mount on Colab to access.

You will have to download the dataset and do the setup or I will have to grant you access.

Please let me know if this is the case.
